# Numerical Optimization â€“ Ulm University

Repository for coursework, lab exercises, and notes developed for the Numerical Optimization module at Ulm University (M.Sc. Computational Science & Engineering).

## Overview

This repository contains personal implementations, derivations, and short reports created during the Numerical Optimization course.  
The goal is to apply and understand numerical methods for solving optimization problems that arise in scientific computing, data analysis, and engineering contexts.  
All content is intended for academic learning and reproducibility.

## Course Topics

The covered topics include:
- Fundamentals of numerical optimization  
- Gradient, Jacobian, and Hessian computation  
- Line search and trust-region methods  
- Constrained optimization (KKT conditions, Lagrange multipliers)  
- Newton, quasi-Newton, and conjugate gradient methods  
- Numerical stability, conditioning, and convergence
